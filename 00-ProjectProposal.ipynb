    "As multiple people in our group play tennis, we decided to focus our project on which biological factors influence the win rate of professional tennis players. Looking at factors such as height, weight, dominant hand preference, wingspan, among other factors, we hope to determine which attributes seem to most heavily influence winning rates for top players. While we recognize that factors such as coaching, years of experience, court type, and more also influence a players performance, we aim to focus on which physical characteristics of the players influence performance.\n",

    "Winning in tennis is attributed to an interaction between training regimen, technical skill, and psychological, and biological factors. Among these, biological factors in the field of tennis is an interesting field of research as it is the least malleable trait. Genetic dispositions such as length of legs could positively or adversely affect span and balance. The scale of how impactful biology can be to the field of tennis is evident by studying handedness. On average, the frequency of the population expressing left handedness is 10%. Among the top 100 professional players, that number skyrockets to 20%<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).\n",

    "Further, one study published in the Scientific Review of Physical Culture analyzes how player height and career win percentage influences serve and return rates on different types of courts. While they found that shorter players tend to have a higher return rate on clay courts, taller players have a higher serve percentage on all types of courts<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). While this study mentions shorter players returning strength and taller players serving rates, how does height impact the remainder of the player’s performance for the remainder of the shots in a point? How large is the impact of serve and return rates on overall match winning rate? This analysis determines which types of court surfaces and winning rates affect serve and return rates, and how height plays a role on different types of courts. Our study aims to look at how height affects winning rates regardless of court type and serve and return percentages. Additionally, our project aims to determine if other biological factors impact player performance as well. This study was helpful in seeing how a similar study to our question was constructed and what metrics were used in their analysis, and we are looking into a question that is looking at more biological factors and simply winning rate. While we recognize from this study that height impacts serve and return rates, we will explore how height impacts overall performance.\n",

    "As mentioned in the paper “Methodology and evaluation in sports analytics: challenges, approaches, and lessons learned” in a Machine Learning Review publication, modern sports analytics face many challenges<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). There are many uses for the advancement of data science and ML modeling in sports, influencing player recruitment, preparation, and predicting team performance. This paper was helpful as it helped us contextualize and understand restrictions and implications of tennis analytics. For example the paper mentions how variables and measurements in sports data are extremely binary. For example, ‘win’ and ‘loss’ does not indicate how well a player performed, as the match could have been extremely close or far in terms of the score. Additionally, another factor the article mentions that was helpful in determining how we will approach our project is that better players often have more chances to compete. In tennis, higher ranked players automatically qualify for tournaments, whereas new or lower ranked players have to try out in order to qualify for the tournament. Because of this, higher ranked players may have won more matches since they have more opportunities to play, which is why we are looking at winning rates proportional to the amount of matches the player has competed in. Overall, this paper gave helpful insights into common pitfalls of sports analytics, while also recommending how sports analytics can be extremely insightful.\n",

    "We predict a strong correlation between the factors of height and left handedness on win rate for professional players. We believe this because of the majority of our groupmates personal experience playing tennis, where we have witnessed that height allows for a higher hit point, giving that player an advantage in ball trajectory and speed. From the personal experience of one of our group members, left handedness is less conventional in tennis, giving that player an advantage because of a difference in playstyle. "

    "The most ideal dataset that would answer our research question to the best ability would be to pull data from professional tennis players around the world. From there, we would look at a combination of their biological and physical attributes that could influence their playing ability. Our team;s independent variables includes, but is not limited to, height, age, weight, gender, and wing span. The dependent variable we will be using is the player's individual win rate. We will only be tracking the win-rates of their singles matches to reduce error. Considering the large amount of data found online about professional tennis players, we plan on using thousands of match outcomes over years of playtime to find the most accurate outcomes. We also wanted to make the sample size large to reduce outliars in the data which may be more common given the data set we are observing. We would use online resources such as the ATP and WTA matchbook website to collect our data. These websites are reliable sources as they are recognized professional tennis organizations and the match scores and player statistics are actively tracked. We plan on storing the data in a structured table format. One table will include player levels and biological attributes and the other will contain win-rates. We will cross compare win-rates with different biological features (for example height) to look for correlations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) are 2 reliable resources that we plan to use. These dataset websites include match outcomes and player rankings, which could be used for our dependent variable table. it also includes ages, heights, and weights of all players which would be helpful for our dependent variable table. The main drawback with this dataset is it would be very time consuming to extract the data into Datahub. \n",

    "Another dataset that would be helpful for our project would be Jeff Sackmann Tennis Match Dataset. This provides similar data to the previous datasets including players, match outcomes, biological attreibutes, and ranking. The main benefit of using Jeff Sackmann's dataset is it is already on Datahub. We could build and expand off of the existing dataset to fit the needs of our project. \n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not completely relevant to our project. Considering that the players we are observing are professional, all of the data we will be observing is public knowledge. We will only be using data that anyone in the public can find, we will just be compiling and analyzing that data. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources we are using are recognized by The International Tennis Federation. The data is collected and reported directly following matches, The best way we could avoid bias while viewing our data is to use more recent data as it is more likely to be reported accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep our dataset anonymous by not including the names of the players involved in our study. personal identifiability is not a large concern of our team due to all of the info being used being available online. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender is available on ATP and WTA, being very public knowledge. This allows us to conduct analysis within tennis leagues without bias. For example we will compare women's statistics to other women and men with other men. This will reduce innate bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our plan is to use publicly available tennis data so these problems aren't relevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [x] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)? We thought about blind spots through thinking about how assumptions about tennis performance might oversimplify the character of a player. We avoid this mistake by acknowledging that quantitative match statistics do not fully capture the full picture of events such as player injuries, mental health, coaching changes, and weather conditions, or maybe even travel fatigue. To mitigate this, we avoided making claims and framed our analysis as more descriptive rather than making our analysis definitive. Another blindspot is that data usually reflects professional seasoned athletes rather than junior players. \n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?  We will examine the dataset for sources of bias. What we might look at could include imbalanced representation across gender, ranking tiers, tournament levels, and surfaces. We noted that higher-ranked and more successful players appear more frequently in the data. This has the potential to skew our results. We were cautious not to generalize findings beyond the scope of the dataset. We also checked for missing values and avoided drawing conclusions from incomplete records.\n",
    " - [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?  Our visualizations and summary statistics are going to be designed to reflect the data. Usually, axes aren’t clearly labelled and importantly, scales are made to skew in odd ways to make visualization look a certain way to prove a point. We will make sure that axes are clearly labeled and scales are not manipulated to exaggerate differences. \n",
    " - [x] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?  The dataset contains publicly available professional tennis data and does not include personally identifiable information beyond player names, which are necessary for contextualizing match outcomes. No private or sensitive information was used or displayed, and we avoided linking the data to external sources that could introduce privacy concerns.\n",
    " - [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?  Our data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps are going to be fully documented in the notebook with explanations of the choices we underwent as a team. Code will be organized and all intermediate steps and thoughts will be put down to make sure our results are reproducible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?  \n",
    "       We have considered that this model might be unfair if we use certain factors such as country of origin, as this could be a proxy for access to resources/funding. We want to heavily consider or avoid using these metrics in our study. \n",
    " - [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?  \n",
    "       When we do the modelling, we expect that there will be differences across the two gender groups represented. We intend to minimize the bias by stratification across gender. This will allow us to consider the differences between the groups and make a fair conclusion. Additionally, we recognize that our pool of tennis players will have a built in racial bias that will reflect the current diversity of professional tennis players. We are unsure how to mitigate this bias in our pool, so we must clearly acknowledge this as a limitation in our study.\n",
    " - [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?  \n",
    "       As we are generally modelling biological factors and in-game statistics, we don't expect that our metrics need optimization or are optimized to create any negative effects. We will need extra consideration if we bring in metrics such as country of origin, which could serve as a proxy for other variables such as access to resources.  \n",
    " - [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?  \n",
    "       Yes, I believe that we will be able to explain why certain factors will influence success in tennis, as we can refer to the biomechanics of playing tennis. We will also be able to analyze correlation between biological factors and in game statistics, such as height on ball speed. This will give us an understanding of what part of the game is most impacted by certain factors.\n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?  \n",
    "       Yes we will communicate the limitations of our study, which are mostly due to the population pool of professional tennis players. We need to emphasize that this study will not be applicable to the average tennis player, where there will be more variance in other factors that are critical for success in tennis, such as experience or training. Because we will limit our study to concrete tennis courts, our conclusions will also be limited by surface. Additionally, our conclusions should not be viewed as a predictor for success in tennis, we only want to understand better what biological factors, if any, have influence on playing tennis at a high level. We do not want our conclusions to discourage people from pursuing tennis, and we need to clearly state these limitations in order to achieve this. \n",
    "       \n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [x] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "       While the model is based on preexisting biological and win-rate data, we can update the model with relevant data from the upcoming tennis season. We can keep up with the upcoming season and the players stats to see if the attributes of winning, highly ranked players align with the predicted biological factors we recognized. We can audit sample predictions by comparing the outcomes of various tournaments such as the U.S. Open and Wimbledon with what our model concluded. \n",
    " - [x] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "       While we do not predict that our analysis will cause distress to users, we will adapt if necessary. We can add a disclaimer that our findings are purely a data analysis of winning statistics and uncontrollable biological factors. We can further reiterate that we recognize many other aspects contribute to the win-rate for professional tennis players, such as coaching, training, and years of experience, among other factors., Our analysis does not intend to be an all-conclusive analysis of why a match was won, simply we wish to explore the relationship between biological factors and winning rates.\n",
    " - [x] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "       Yes, as the project is all in the group repository, we can change the status to private if the model is causing harm or having unintended effects. Then, only contributors will be able to see the model and either change it or leave it as private, depending on the circumstances.\n",
    " - [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "       Yes, if the model is being used in unintended ways then we will implement aspects of our roll back plan to reevaluate, then continue to monitor from there.\n"
