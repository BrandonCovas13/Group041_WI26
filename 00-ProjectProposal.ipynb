    "We predict a strong correlation between the factors of height and left handedness on win rate for professional players. We believe this because of the majority of our groupmates personal experience playing tennis, where we have witnessed that height allows for a higher hit point, giving that player an advantage in ball trajectory and speed. From the personal experience of one of our group members, left handedness is less conventional in tennis, giving that player an advantage because of a difference in playstyle. "

    " - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",

    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",

    "### C. Analysis\n",

    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?  \n",
    "       We have considered that this model might be unfair if we use certain factors such as country of origin, as this could be a proxy for access to resources/funding. We want to heavily consider or avoid using these metrics in our study. \n",
    " - [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?  \n",
    "       When we do the modelling, we expect that there will be differences across the two gender groups represented. We intend to minimize the bias by stratification across gender. This will allow us to consider the differences between the groups and make a fair conclusion. Additionally, we recognize that our pool of tennis players will have a built in racial bias that will reflect the current diversity of professional tennis players. We are unsure how to mitigate this bias in our pool, so we must clearly acknowledge this as a limitation in our study.\n",
    " - [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?  \n",
    "       As we are generally modelling biological factors and in-game statistics, we don't expect that our metrics need optimization or are optimized to create any negative effects. We will need extra consideration if we bring in metrics such as country of origin, which could serve as a proxy for other variables such as access to resources.  \n",
    " - [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?  \n",
    "       Yes, I believe that we will be able to explain why certain factors will influence success in tennis, as we can refer to the biomechanics of playing tennis. We will also be able to analyze correlation between biological factors and in game statistics, such as height on ball speed. This will give us an understanding of what part of the game is most impacted by certain factors.\n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?  \n",
    "       Yes we will communicate the limitations of our study, which are mostly due to the population pool of professional tennis players. We need to emphasize that this study will not be applicable to the average tennis player, where there will be more variance in other factors that are critical for success in tennis, such as experience or training. Because we will limit our study to concrete tennis courts, our conclusions will also be limited by surface. Additionally, our conclusions should not be viewed as a predictor for success in tennis, we only want to understand better what biological factors, if any, have influence on playing tennis at a high level. We do not want our conclusions to discourage people from pursuing tennis, and we need to clearly state these limitations in order to achieve this. \n",
    "       \n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
